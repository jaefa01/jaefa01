Hi there,
i´m Fabian (jaefa01), 37 years old and father of two little boys.
I have been working as a process mechanic for about 20 years in my learned profession.
There, too, I am busy programming machines and robots, among other things.
This is the work I enjoy most.

Gradually, I became aware of software development.
It fascinates me and I have decided to devote myself intensively to the topic.
I'm at the very beginning and i´am currently learn HTML/CSS&JavaScript.
I follow the Freecodecamp Curricullum and do courses on Udemy after work and after family.
